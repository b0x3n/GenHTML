   <h1><a name="Input_file_structure">Input file structure</a></h1>
    <p>
Input files are structured using indentation.
    </p>    <p>
The level of indentation tells GenHTML what type of element the line data is to be wrapped in.
    </p>    <p>
There are 4 main types of element:
    </p>    <pre>

   Headers
   Subheaders
   Paragraphs
   Pre blocks
    </pre>    <p>
Which we can define using relative indentation.
    </p>    <h2><a name="_Headers">Headers</a></h2>    <p>
A single input file may only contain a single header - this can be thought of as the main wrapper or page container, everything that follows belongs to the main header in that page.
    </p>    <p>
When GenHTML builds the output, headers and subheaders are used to generate links so that pages and sections can be easily navigated.
    </p>    <p>
The header always has zero indentation, and everything that belongs to it will have an indentation of 1 or more.
    </p>    <h2><a name="_Subheaders">Subheaders</a></h2>    <p>
A subheader allows us to break a page into linkable sections. We can think of these as children to the main page header.
    </p>    <p>
It's basically a form of nesting - to create a new subheader all you need to do is make sure it's a single line of text and is indented 1 space more than the container.
    </p>    <p>
We can then divide the sub-sections by adding further subheaders - but we can only go two sub-sections deep - example:
    </p>    <pre>

    |This is the parent header
    |
    | This is child header 1
    |
    |  This is grandchild header 1.1
    |
    |  This is grandchild header 1.2
    |
    | This is child header 2
    |
    |  This is grandchild header 2.1
    </pre>    <p>
I added the | characters to highlight the left edge of the text file and illustrate the level of indentation and why it's important.
    </p>    <p>
I've limited GenHTML to this level of depth as it suited my needs, this may change with new versions or iterations.
    </p>    <h2><a name="_Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a></h2>    <p>
A paragraph is one or more lines that ends in one of:
    </p>    <pre>

    .   ,   :   ;   !   ?
    </pre>    <p>
Characters.
    </p>    <p>
A paragraph will have an indentation of 1 space more than the parent header or subheader it belongs to.
    </p>    <p>
Example:
    </p>    <pre>

    |Section one
    |
    | This paragraph belongs to section 1. We can
    | add as many as we like, but a paragraph may
    | not contain a blank line,
    |
    | This will just result in a new paragraph
    | being opened.
    |
    | 
    | Sub header one
    |
    |  Now this paragraph belongs to Sub header
    |  one. If we want, we can divide this section
    |  up like so:
    |
    |  Sub header one point one
    |
    |   Struggling to think of stuff to type for
    |   this example, any ideas?
    </pre>    <p>
I think you get the idea!
    </p>    <h2><a name="_Pre_blocks">Pre blocks</a></h2>    <p>
These are similar to paragraphs, except we can include empty lines.
    </p>    <p>
We must also indent the block 3 places more than the containing header:
    </p>    <pre>

    |A block of pre
    |
    | We can use this to output examples of code,
    | command output, etc:
    |
    |   Here is a block of pre text.
    |
    |   We can leave blank lines, GenHTML will
    |   know the pre block is over when we 
    |   drop the level of indentation.
    |
    | Now we're back into a paragraph.
    </pre>    <p>
There's a slight issue with this - the first line of the block MUST be indented 3 places more than the header or subheader it belongs to - and all subsequent lines must be at least the same level of indentation.
    </p>    <p>
For now it serves my purpose but in future iterations or versions this is likely to be changed.
    </p>    <h2><a name="_File_index">File index</a></h2>    <p>
GenHTML expects an index file as its main source of input. This one file may contain any of the elements described above.
    </p>    <p>
It can also contain an index of input files to be included in the build, we do this by using an indentation that is 2 spaces greater than the containing header or subheader.
    </p>    <p>
For example, if we have a directory named txt that contains our index:
    </p>    <pre>

    txt/index
    </pre>    <p>
Then we can do:
    </p>    <pre>

    php GenHTML --i txt/index --o doc
    </pre>    <p>
Firstly, this will tell GenHTML that to load the index and that all of the input files should be referenced relative to the txt/ directory.
    </p>    <p>
Now, we can write our index something like:
    </p>    <pre>

    |A GenHTML demo
    |
    |  File one
    |  File two
    |
    | Files one and two are not very interesting,
    | hey - it's just an example!
    </pre>    <p>
This tells GenHTML to include the files:
    </p>    <pre>

    txt/File-one
    txt/File-two
    </pre>    <p>
The spaces are replaced with - characters to prevent issues with filenames and spaces.
    </p>    <p>
So now GenHTML will attempt to load the additional files, what does this mean in terms of the output?
    </p>    <h2><a name="_Output_files">Output files</a></h2>    <p>
By default, GenHTML will create a single-page HTML document, even if there are multiple input files.
    </p>    <p>
It will compile them all into a single document and create links to the various sections for navigation.
    </p>    <p>
If we specify the -multi-page switch, then GenHTML will create an individual HTML document for each input file, and they will be linked externally via a common index.html, as well as linked internally using anchors.
    </p>    <p>
To create a multi-page document:
    </p>    <pre>

    php GenHTML --i txt/index --o doc -multi-page
    </pre>    <p>
Remember you can also use the short form -m switch, as well as the -silent or -s switches to suppress output to the terminal during the build.
